FlexCel is digitally signed, to guarantee that the package has not been modified.

That key is not delivered with the source, so you need to create your own, by changing to the "key" folder and running GenerateKey.bat

Once you create your own key, you can compile and use it normally, but it will be signed different than the original package.

To succesfully run GenerateKey.bat, sn.exe (from the .net SDK) should be on your search path.
